usage: ./ffpassdecrypt.py [paths_to_location_of_files]

Run it with no parameters to extract the standard passwords from all profiles of the current logged in user,
or with an optional '-P' argument (before any path) to query the master password for decryption.

Required files:
   + key3.db
   + signons.sqlite
   + cert8.db
are used and needed to collect the passwords.
